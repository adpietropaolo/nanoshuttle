 Open data of the enhanced sampling simulations using PLUMED packages
 of fluorescent soft nanoshuttles binding folate receptor alpha varying the length of ethylene glycol repeating units (4, 8 or 16)
 as m04, m08 and m16 in this repository.
 The coordinates belonging to the free-energy minimum of the complex, the topologies, the force field parameters and plumed files
 are available in the plumed-nest repository.
